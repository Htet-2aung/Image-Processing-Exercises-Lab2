## Image Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The script includes operations such as rotating a specific region of an image, in this case, a balloon, by 20 degrees and saving the modified image. The final image with all modifications is displayed using OpenCV's [`imshow`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FHtet%20Aung%2FDocuments%2FDocuments%2FImage_Processing%2FLab02%2FEx2_1.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A54%2C%22character%22%3A3%7D%7D%5D%2C%22aaf2fb3e-f8ce-4609-8078-f1db692b94be%22%5D "Go to definition") function.
